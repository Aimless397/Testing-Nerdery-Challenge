### Testing challenge
This challenge was created to help you practicing with some testing exercises.

#### How to use it?
- Download this repo and install its dependecies (npm install)
- All the code you need to test is in one single file `index.js`
- To run the tests use the command `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`

#### How to test?
- Import the function you want to test from the `index.spect.ts` file, eg: import { isInteger } from './index';
- Some of the functions return an error or can have additional validations, make sure to test those scenarios

#### Notes:
- All the exported functions need to be tested
- You need to get at least 80% of coverage
